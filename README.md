# Password Generator Scrimba FrontEnd Module 3 - Essential Javascript Concepts 

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
````

See [Demo](https://shahs-password-generator.netlify.app/)
Note that the demo is of my react version that has dark mode. This repo lacks dark mode but otherwise is identical. 

This password generator was actually made via React. You can see the react version of the repo [here](https://github.com/Pharma2022/password-generator-react/) . 

## Functionality
- First select if you want your passwords to include numbers, letters or symbols using the checkboxes
- On submission, random passwords will be rendered. This is achieved through indexing the selected array . 
- You can copy the generated password 

##Frameworks/Libraries/Apis used
- Math.random()
- Navigator Clipboard API
- Use of spread operator 

## Stretch goals
- I have recoded this using react, mainly because I wanted to integrate dark mode - it is possible to achieve this without react though
- I have also added copy functionality 

## Further Stretch Goals/General Improvements
- I would like to break my CSS into typography to make maintenance easier from a responsive design point of view
- It would be nice to save the arrays on firebase instead of having them here.
